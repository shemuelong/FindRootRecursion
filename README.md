# FindRootRecursion
Short program that uses recursion to find the root of a function between two parameters

Given an arbitrary mathematical function and a valid range, we can use a recursive algorithm to find the root.
In this example, we have a sine function whose graph has been uploaded as an image.
The algorithm is run to find 2 roots in the given picture.
